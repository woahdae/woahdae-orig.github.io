excerpt: 'See how to make a U-lock saddle holster that will outperform
most plastic attachments provided with the locks. Cost-free,
rattle-free, and easy to use. Plus, DIY projects are fun!'
---

Carrying 4 pounds of U-shaped steel rod on your bike in a way that is
convenient, secure, and rattle-free has few great solutions.

You don't have to take my word for it, just go look at the reviews for
bike locks on Amazon. One of the most common complaints isn't about the
lock, but with how the lock attaches to the bike. All locks I know of come
with some type of plastic attachment to mount the lock with,
but usually in the main triangle of your frame (an otherwise valuable space),
and are often rattly or just poorly designed.

"There HAS to be a better way!"

Well, last summer I went looking for the best way to store my U-Lock
and eventually found this great handmade product:

<div class="panel panel-default linkish-glow">
  <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/100067846/bicycle-u-lock-holster-tan-leather"
     target="_blank">

               rel="noshare" />
        </div>

        <div class="col-sm-6">
          <h5>Leather Bicycle U-Lock Holster</h5>

          <ul class="compact-list">
            <li><small>$29 (+$7 shipping to Seattle)</small></li>
            <li><small>Handmade in Canada</small></li>
            <li><small>386 reviews, 4.5 star average.</small></li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </a>
</div>

I was impatient and in a DIY mood, so instead of pulling the
trigger on the leather holster, the inner-tube version was born!

This system has gotten a lot of compliments in its 9 months of service,
so I thought it was about time to officially document how to make it.

If your seat doesn't have eyelets but you still want one of these
holsters, you can get some <a
href="http://store.velo-orange.com/index.php/components/saddles/velo-orange-saddle-loops.html"
target="_blank">screw-together saddle loops</a>. **OR**, in the spirit
of DIY, find a way to make it work without the loops! I'd love to hear
about that.

## How to make an inner-tube u-lock holster

Note, "left" and "right" are from the perspective of facing the back of the
saddle, as seen in the majority of the photos.

          Also, bring your attention to the random-seeming screw in my
          brake cable hanger (visible in some of the earlier pictures).
          Originally I set this up when I had the cantilever cable going
          through where the screw is, performing the critical function of
          enforcing bottom of the "V" shape you see in these photos.
          After re-routing the cable out of this area for different brakes, the
          holster tubing had nothing keeping it from sliding sideways and turned
          into more of a "U" shape, resulting in the bottom of the lock coming
          loose and banging around. The screw is for maintaining the
          bottom of the "V" so that can't happen. You'll probably
          have to come up with a similar hack if you don't already have something
          bisecting your seat stay.

## Review of the inner-tube holster

This isn't just a DIY article, it's also a ~2000mi review!

So, how did it do?

### Pros

* User friendly
* Lightweight
* Secure (as in your lock won't fall out)
* Rattle proof
* Weather proof
* Allows seat height/angle changes without holster adjustment, which is
  probably less true if made of materials like leather.
* Costs nothing
* "Green" (reuse is better than recycling, by a lot)

### Cons

* *Relatively* difficult to install. Not too difficult, but more so
  than other ways of carrying a lock.
* Extra difficulty swapping seats once installed
* Requires saddle loops found mainly on touring saddles
* Precludes the use of a saddle bag
* Main holster loop is "sticky" until the rubber wears in (a week maybe?)

### Conclusion

If this was an Amazon review, I'd give it 4.5 stars.

It's secure, easy to use, and probably even "in style" for Seattle
since people pay top dollar for [locally made bags and wallets using
recycled rubber](http://www.alchemygoods.com/). It's not without it's
drawbacks, but I'm calling them "drawbacks" rather than faults.

In terms of durability, 2000mi isn't really enough to say anything
definitive, but so far, so good. Early on the tube developed some slits
around the saddle loop knots from rubbing the corners of the loops, but
they haven't progressed in over a thousand miles.
If any single section of tube were to snap, I still *think* the lock
would be held on by enough other sections that there wouldn't be a
single point of failure. In other words, you'd likely notice your
holster was broken before your lock got dropped on the ground.

That's it! I don't blog for profit, so please send a pic if you made one :)
