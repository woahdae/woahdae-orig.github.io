Adapted from "Eating on the Wild Side: The Missing Link to Optimum Health"

The original is, on paper, one of the most nutritious meals you can make
(including being a good source of iron!), but it is way too sweet for us. We
love savory & umami flavors, so this has more garlic, no apricots or added
sugar, and instead uses dried porcini mushrooms, fish sauce, and white wine
vinegar. The finishing fat (coconut cream or sour cream) is a must.

If you don't have fish sauce or porcini mushrooms, no worries! Garlic and spices
should be great, but especially if you're used to meaty dishes, the mushrooms
and fish sauce add a bit of umami you might miss without meat.

Also, this dish makes me SUPER farty if I don't soak my lentils for 24h and add
some Indian spices (~1/2 tsp tumeric, ~1 tsp coriander). Morgan does not
experience the same effect. You've been warned.

Ingredient Trivia:

* Tomatoes, dried mushrooms (reconstituted in boiling water), and fish sauce
  are all potent sources of umami ("the 5th taste").
* Black lentils have the most cancer-fighting anticyonins of all types of lentils.
* Canned tomatoes are healthier than store-bought tomatoes, and equally as healthy
  as fresh picked tomatoes, because they are usually canned within hours of being
  picked at peak freshness. Store-bought tomatoes are picked well before they are
  ready, and ripen en-route to the store, yielding blander and less nutritious
  tomatoes!
* Some of garlic's health effects take 10 minutes to stabilize after chopping or crushing
  to stand up to heat, and are more effective when crushed vs chopped. So,
  always crush garlic 10 min before adding to heat for maximum health benefits.

### Ingredients

* 1 tablespoon garlic, crushed (about half a head)
* 1/4 oz dried porcini mushrooms
* 1 cup dried lentils. Black is most nutritious, followed by green (French), or red
* 2 cups bone broth, or vegetable broth for vegetarians/vegans
* 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
* 1 yellow onion, diced
* 1 red, green, yellow, or orange bell pepper, 1/2‑inch dice
* 1 28‑ounce can diced tomatoes (I like the fire-roasted kind), undrained
* 1 medium unpeeled eggplant, 1/2 inch dice
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice or ground cloves
* 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or more or less to taste
* 1 tsp fish sauce
* 2 teaspoons kosher salt or 1 teaspoon sea salt, more or less to taste (we use
  a tablespoon or more)
* 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
* 4 tablespoons chopped Italian (flat-leaf) parsley or chopped fresh mint for garnish
* Optional - Indian spices may reduce gas from lentils (tumeric, coriander,
  etc). Toss some in (and cross your fingers) if this is a problem for you!

### Cooking

##### Rehydrate the mushrooms

Put the mushrooms in 1 cup of water in a medium/large sauce pan and heat for
about 5 minutes until they are soft.

Fish the mushrooms out of the water, dice them small, and add the lentils
