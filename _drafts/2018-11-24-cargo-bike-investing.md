I don't know how bikes have become to be valued as toys, but just a few years ago I shared that perspective.

My first commuter was an old steel mountain bike I picked up in college. I got it off a guy living on a boat in Lake Union for $70, where he pulled it out of a dockside container full of used bikes. I felt like $70 was a reasonable price for a bike, so I didn't see anything wrong with the situation.

Once out of college and making better money, I went to Performance Bicycle (RIP) and splurged - $700 for a cyclocross bike! My roommates thought I was nuts to spend that kind of money since I didn't race. I put a used rack and an Ortlieb on it to be a "grocery getter," but every time I tried getting groceries, I'd come home with my wheels rubbing the brakes. I'd take it to Performance, and their top wheelbuilder (so I was told) would fix the wheels. Wash, rince, repeat. One time my recently-trued wheels were dishing so badly I had an explosive flat on the rear because the brakes rubbed the sidewall off on a mild decent. Performance didn't have an answer, so I read "The Bicycle Wheel" cover to cover. Yes I'm great at parties. Anyways, it was clear then why my wheel kept falling out of true, and it was equally clear the wheelbuilder at Performance had no idea how wheels worked aside from the mechanical ability to build them up. The answer, by the way, was that the rim and spokes were cheap racing wheels only good for about 180lbs total. The failure mode of a spoked wheel is for spokes to lose tension as they come under load (i.e. while they are between the hub and ground as the wheel turns). This alternating loading/unloading wreaks havoc on the spoke tension, and in no time your wheel alignment turns to shit. Maybe they just didn't want to tell me I can't do what I want with the bike?

For a bike to replace a car in the often rainy, dark, hilly, congested, rutted roads of the Pacific Northwest, most people end up needing a pretty nice bike. Before having kids, lots of people get away with underbiking[^underbiking]
