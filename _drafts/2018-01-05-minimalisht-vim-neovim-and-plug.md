excerpt: 'Years ago I asked myself what I could do to keep the self-sufficiency
dream alive while saving up for my homesteading mid-life crisis, and my
vermicomposting hobby turned out to be one of the easiest and most
rewarding ways to stay connected with nature while still living in
apartments.'

I started coding Ruby with TextMate back when TextMate was cool, and
switched to Vim via Janus while waiting for TextMate 2. Janus provided a
nice starting point for a TextMate convert - simple like TextMate,
because it's Vim, but with a lot of stuff to explore under the hood.

Janus was still a bit too much - adding/updating plugins always
required a googling because I couldn't remember how to do it the once a
year I tried, it loaded a bunch of stuff I never used, and was randomly
slow and/or crashed while thinking hard doing mundane things like
writing a buffer.

Now that NeoVim is well on its way, Mac OS has a few good GUI clients
for it (I like vimr), and vim plugin management has progressed, what's
the slickest minimal-ish vim setup?

Well, here's my one-page NeoVim config using vim-plug. This is it! No
plugin directories, layers of config files, or hidden features. Know
this one file, and know your (neo)vim.
