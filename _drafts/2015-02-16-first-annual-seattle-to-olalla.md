TIL: The Greater Seattle Area has an amazing bike network! When
paired with the excellence of Google Maps' bike routing, DIY-ers can
create a "[supported ride](#supported-ride)" experience on a whim.

I had a free weekend and wanted to get away to one of my dad's
mini-cabins, and how better to travel to a cabin in the woods than by bike?
I expected to have a couple nice trails, but mostly be back-road or inner-city
riding.

Well, check out the density of green or dotted-green around the
sound! When I first saw this I figured it was mostly bike lanes and
sharrows unless I wanted to opt for the ferry, but the dark green is
paved non-motorized paths, and there are a lot!

This might be old news to the people [advocating](http://www.railstotrails.org/) [for](https://www.facebook.com/ForeverGreenCouncil) [trails](http://wabikes.org/) in the
greater Seattle area, but it's news to me, and seemed to be news to the
bikers I've been talking to afterwards.

This is the gist of the trip from Seattle to Olalla. The
details aren't necessarily interesting, but what *is* interesting is how
much of it is non-motor trails:

## <a name="supported-ride"></a> The "supported ride" feel

Since I had no idea what to expect (and to practice my "survivor man") I
packed misc food, four water bottles, a lightweight water filtering system,
an ultralight stove, two MREs, and printed all my directions. I also
brought a 20,000mAh battery pack with me so I could make sure I had
plenty of juice if I had to plan a return trip via public transportation.

In reality... that was overkill by a _lot_. Almost the whole trip takes
place blocks from major food chains
and public transportation lines. I didn't plan my stops ahead of time,
and stopped for food at places I could have thrown a rock at from the
trail. I rode right by a couple buses and a train headed north, so
if I needed to turn around I could have took a long walk or cheap taxi
to a train or bus. This is perfect for a "first ride of the season" or
spontaneous travel urge. The only part I would not have wanted to break
down on was [the River Road section](#river-road), but that's not bad at all for a
worst-case scenario.


## A Ride Report

It was awesome to bike through the southern parts of the greater
Seattle area. Previously my only exposure was I-5 at 60mph; at 15mph,
you feel more connected to the supporting areas of your home city. Plus, how
cool is it that we have such a great bike network to explore it with?

The Green River Trail was winding with good woods; the Interurban Trail was a
smooth, gently rolling track enabling a personally high speed of
20mph; the Scott Pierson Trail was a lot of fun, probably because it was a
winding downhill, in the dark, and surrounded by the city lights.

<img class="img-thumbnail enable-zoom x4 pull-left" style="margin-right: 10px;" width="160" src="/img/first-annual-seattle-to-olalla/narrows.jpg" />
Nighttime riding over the new Narrows Bridge was the highlight of my trip.
Speeding across a void of black space, into oncoming lights,
opposed by a strong crosswind for great dramatic effect... it could only be
more Pacific Northwest with a light rain. If you don't find presence there, you
won't find it anywhere!

The rest of the ride was pretty standard for the area (that's a
compliment!). Winding woodland, rolling hills, and crazy loud crickets,
all framed by intermittent views of the Cascades looming in the distance.

### My roadside attractions & pit stops:

* [Beacon Hill Food Forest](http://www.beaconfoodforest.org/)
* <img class="img-thumbnail enable-zoom x3 pull-right" style="margin-left: 5px;" width="150" src="/img/first-annual-seattle-to-olalla/tacos.jpg" />
  Choice of: Arby's, Taco Bell, or Jack in the Box, a stone's throw from
  the start of the main Interurban Trail stretch, which is a great
  (er, convenient) way to fuel up for this "bike highway" leg of the trip.
* Tacoma's Freighthouse Square
* Tacoma Narrows Bridge

### Situationally uncomfortable roadways

* The jump from the Interurban trail to Puyallup is on a posted
  30mph shared lane, but is winding (so double-yellow lanes) with no
  shoulder for about 4 miles. I'd do it again myself
  since one cyclist is easy enough to pass, but if I had a larger group
  I'd find a different route through there if possible.
* <a name="river-road"></a>The route from Puyallup to Tacoma is via River
  Road, which looks like a quaint river stretch on the map, but is 100% a
  freeway. It has a posted speed limit of 50mph, but I doubt anybody was doing
  50\. Yes, it does have a good sized shoulder, but I still don't like having
  cars, trucks, buses, etc whiz by. Since the visibility on the highway is
  great, I'm probably more likely to get doored in a Seattle bike lane, but
  still. No bueno.

### Cool people

* I kept passing & being passed by a couple biking from lower Queen Anne
  to Tacoma. "I'm not the only one!" is a good feeling! I finally lost them
  when I got a screw in my tire on River Road.
* A guy in the Freighthouse Square started chatting about bikes, and
  wanted to double-check my route. He gave me a plan to avoided the Hilltop
  area, which is a must at night. Lots of drug-related shenanigans in that area.
* <img class="img-thumbnail enable-zoom x4 pull-right" style="margin-left: 5px;" width="100" src="/img/first-annual-seattle-to-olalla/band-brake.jpg" />
  A guy named Rick on the return-trip ferry chatted with me about
  biking during the whole ferry ride, and pointed me to some great resources &
  tricks. I especially like his idea of leaving a rubber band on your drops to
  wrap around your brake when you don't want it rolling. Thanks Rick!
  He also pointed me to [Bike Works](http://bikeworks.org/), where he
  volunteers on Sundays.
