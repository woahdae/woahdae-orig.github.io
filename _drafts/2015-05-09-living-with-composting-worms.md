I believe personal food production is the simplest path to freedom.

Unfortunately, my current lifestyle is far, far away from being
able to produce my own food. My dream lifestyle would be to live on a
homestead and work in the city, but [the true cost of commuting is
obscene](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/10/06/the-true-cost-of-commuting/),
and honestly living in the city is wildly fun and convenient. So for
now, I'm a city boy looking for ways to get my hands in the dirt.

Years ago I asked myself what I could do to keep the self-sufficiency
dream alive while saving up for my homesteading mid-life crisis, and my
vermicomposting hobby turned out to be one of the easiest and most
rewarding ways I stay connected to nature while still living in
small city spaces.

I acknowledge this is a long article, but I wanted to put all of my
thoughts in one place rather than spreading them out among several
less-coherently-joined articles.

So, here's a table of contents to help you pick what you're interested in:

1. [Why Vermicompost?](#why-vermicompost) - We already have
   unparallelled access to _how_ to do something - _why_ is far more
   interesting.
2. [Lessons Learned](#lessons-learned) - some observations you won't
   find from other sources (or at least I didn't)
3. [FAQ](#faq) - I get a lot of the some questions when I tell
   people I keep a compost bin in my small apartments
4. [A Call to Action](#call-to-action) - Get worms! Get worms now!

### Why Vermicompost?

**Personal food production starts with good soil, good soil starts with
good compost, and [some of the best compost in the world is
worm castings (worm poop)](http://www.tastefulgarden.com/store/pc/Worm-Castings-d114.htm).**

It's on par with concentrated fertilizer; "black gold," as one company brands it.

I feed mine coffee grounds, lettuce, bread (small amounts), ground
eggshells, junk mail, and just about everything you could put in a
salad, all from a wide variety of sources. Variety is the key to good
compost, and I would be surprised if you could manage similar variety at
a production scale.

**Also, the voracious Red Wigglers used in this type of composting system
seriously put away the produce**.

They'll turn a weeks' worth of veggie
scraps, coffee grounds, egg shells, and junk mail into soil in a 2-foot
cube, week after week. [Worms can put
away a half pound of produce per pound of
worms](http://www.recycleworks.org/compost/wormfood.html), and a pound
of worms is what you _start_ with when you're getting set up. In my mature
bin, handfuls of scraps go in and a week later it's dirt.

**On a responsibility scale of goldfish to goldendoodle, they're at
less than goldfish**.

You _should_ feed them weekly, but I've gone as
long as a month without feeding them (after completely filling the bin)
and they were totally OK. Other chores: once a month I shred junk mail, once
every three months I rotate the bins, and once a year I save & grind
some eggshells. All "chores" the 5-year-old in me loves, by the way.

Finally, compared to purchasing castings, my back-of-the-napkin
estimate is **you generate the equivalent of $40-$160/yr by keeping your
own worms**.

You can buy worm
castings just about anywhere; Amazon sells good stuff
with Prime shipping - [the "Wiggle Worm" brand at $40 per cubic
foot](http://www.amazon.com/Pure-Organic-EC415-Earthworm-Castings/dp/B00062KQ42/ref=sr_1_sc_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1427312622&sr=8-1-spell&keywords=worm+castnings)
(a 30lb bag is roughly 1 cubic foot). Each Worm Factory tray holds about
2ft x 2ft x ~1in (1/3 cubic foot) when it is ready to harvest, I harvest
maybe 2-4x per year, and the manufacturer claims as much as one harvest
per month.

So, since I feed my worms maybe a couple salads' worth of
scrap veggies/coffee/etc per week, I personally expect about 1 cubic
foot per year, so $40/year on a pure dollar-value basis. The
manufacturer would claim up to $160/year (4 cubic feet per year), and
I'll believe this.

### Why Not to Vermicompost?

I think cost and space are really non-issues, as detailed above, so
what might be stopping you?

**Do you think composting and worms are cool, or gross?**

  <img width="200" src="/img/living-with-composting-worms/yay_worms.jpg" />
</div>

Take a look at this image of my worms eating an apple (I turned it over
so you could see them, they eat stuff bottom-up) - does it totally gross
you out?

By my experience, most people think the worms are cool but don't really
want to mess with them without gloves, which is understandable.

Personally, I still have the attitude of a small
child when it comes to playing with dirt and worms, so I love worm time!

Another minority of people seem grossed out by worms and compost bins,
so if this is you, putting them under your counter might not be
the best idea. Do some soul-searching with the above image.

Which camp are you in? Still with me?

Note they tend to stay just under the surface, so for the most part
you're not interacting with them, but you will have to when you rotate
the bins.

### Lessons Learned

When first getting started I read lots of material, including "[Worms
Eat My
Garbage](http://www.amazon.com/Worms-Eat-My-Garbage-Composting/dp/0977804518/),"
and this post is no substitute for a great resource like that. I still
learned a lot about what matters after actually having apartment worms,
though:

#### Always cover compost with shredded paper

A couple inches of shredded paper, wall-to-wall, keeps everything
aerated while also somehow discouraging flies (including fruit flies).
I'm not sure why, you'd think they'd just crawl through the paper
anyways, but it works. Neglecting this doesn't guarantee an "Attack of
the Fruit Flies" scenario, in fact you'll probably be fine (my bin is
currently low on paper), but maintaining coverage is the top
preventative measure I'd recommend if you're worried about keeping
flying pests from settling in.

#### A hidden cost: the paper shredder

In the wild, Red Wigglers hang out in piles of dead leaves and eat
fallen fruit. So, in the simulated leaf pile under your sink, half their
diet should be high-carbon materials like shredded paper, and the other
half should be the table scraps and such you're looking to get rid of.

I tried shredding paper by hand, then "upgraded" to a hand-cranked
paper shredder, and eventually went all-in on an office grade shredder.
It's actually a nice thing to have anyways for ID theft security, but
I wouldn't keep one in my apartment just for that.

As an unexpected benefit, I do love turning advertisers' junk into part
of my food chain! Well, the non-glossy junk.

If you don't want a shredder, I've since noticed how offices
generate piles and piles of shredded paper, so you could repurpose that
too. A garbage bag of shredded paper should last a couple months, so
I wouldn't think it'd be too much of a hassle to coordinate.

#### Prioritize convenience

When I was first getting started, my worm bin was inaccessible without
taking it out of the cabinet, and taking it out was a mild chore since you
had to reach in and grab it from the worst lifting posture imaginable.
So, I got a separate countertop compost pale to keep scraps in while I
was mustering the will to dice them for the worm bin. Even though this
was a purpose-built bin with a fully seal-able top and a carbon filter,
fruit flies would still hatch (they come in the skin of some fruit) and
the whole thing would turn in to a fruit fly bomb. It was pretty gross.

It turns out, if you add veggies to the compost bin immediately, for
whatever reason fruit flies aren't a problem. Maybe the eggs don't
hatch, or the flies don't come out past the shredded paper, or they get
eaten by bacteria or something. Oh well, I'll take it! I haven't
had any fruit fly issues after making access to my worm bin more
convenient, therefore obviating the desire for my countertop pale.

#### Vermicomposting self-manages, so don't be a hover composter

Quick & easy compost disposal is one of the major benefits of an
under-the-sink Worm Factory, so don't lose that benefit by making things
harder than they need to be by pampering your bin.

I initially had the impression you needed to run a really tight
worm-ship, involving pre-chopping, moisture management, strategic food
placement, mold removal, etc or else Bad Things Will Happen in your
compost bin.

Fast forward four years. Due to eventual lack of time and
patience, I've let all of that go, and everything's fine. I've seen
moulds come and go. I've had smells come and go. I've thrown in
half-rotten and moldy fruit and watched it disappear, and I place scraps
wherever seems to be room and it all gets eaten. **At least for
reasonable deviations, the system is flexible and can take care of
itself**.

I don't mean to encourage neglect, but I do mean to encourage
giving vermicomposting a try, and it's easier than the literature might
make you think. I originally expected it would be more like managing a
fish tank (for the uninitiated, small fish tanks can be a huge hassle),
but in reality it mostly just works.

### FAQ / Common Questions

It's fun to tell people I keep worms in my apartment, and I get a lot of
the same questions:

#### Q: Does it smell?

Practically, never; technically, sometimes.

It has never made my kitchen or apartment smell, and I currently live in ~350
square feet, so I'd know if it did.

However, if you opened up the cabinets and stuck your nose in the worm
bin, the smell would range from (ideally) mountain plains after a fresh
rain to (less ideally) a bit of a barn smell.

Smelly food is due to _anaerobic_ decomposition. For example, when you
or a loved one leaves a Tupperware experiment sealed in the fridge, the
impending smell-tastrophe is entirely the result of anaerobic microbes
breaking down last months' dinner in an oxygen-less environment.

_Aerobic_ decomposition doesn't smell, and one major purpose of the
worms is to aerate the soil, resulting in efficient and *odorless*
decomposition with an accompanying "fresh soil" scent.

I'll admit, my bin is usually a bit off of the mountain plains standard,
presumably due to small, temporary pockets of anaerobic decomposition
resulting from large clumps of food or too much food at once. I don't
notice it unless I look, and it fixes itself over time, so in my book
it's not actually a problem worth solving.

#### Q: Can they escape?

An environment like the Worm Factory provides them a close replica of
their natural environment, plus they don't last long on dry surfaces, so
I think it's safe to say they'll either be in the worm bin, or nowhere
at all.

I've read that some worms might try to leave the bin if the conditions
are really dire, but it'd be a last-ditch effort to run for their little
wormy lives.

#### Q: What can you feed them?

It's a common question, so it deserves to be called out in my FAQ, but
I won't get too detailed since all bins come with comprehensive feeding
instructions.

Basically:

Anything that might go into a salad other than
dressing and meat.

[Here's a good online resource for more info](http://www.recycleworks.org/compost/wormfood.html), as well as the classic book "[Worms Eat My Garbage](http://www.amazon.com/Worms-Eat-My-Garbage-Composting/dp/0977804518/)".

### A Call to Action

The world badly needs good soil, and people living in cities badly need
to be more connected to their food cycle. I can think of no simpler way
than a worm bin.

If you'd like to help feed my blogging habit, you can use my affiliate
links to [get yourself a
shredder](http://www.amazon.com/Bonsaii-Strip-Cut-Protection-Continuous-Wastebasket/dp/B00NUX1WGK/ref=lp_172591_1_12?s=office-electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1428862140&sr=1-12)
and [a Worm Factory](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000S6LZBO) first.

Then, after it's set up, you can find Red Wigglers in your local
hardware store, oddly enough. If you're thinking of ordering worms
online, use your own judgment as to whether it seems safe for the worms.
All the one-star reviews for ["Uncle
Jim's"](http://www.amazon.com/Uncle-Jims-Worm-Farm-Composting/dp/B000Q5S7RM/)
worms were from June 2011, which was just a couple months before I
started composting, so I didn't buy online. At the moment it seems like
all the reviews are positive, so it's probably fine, just pay more
attention than usual to where exactly your purchase is coming from.

And if you do end up setting something up, let me know! That fuels my
blogging habit too.
