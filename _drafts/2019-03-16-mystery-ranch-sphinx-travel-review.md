In this post I'll be focusing on why I am loving the new Sphinx hiking pack for
my families packception travel strategy (which I'll also describe). In fact I
think it's my favorite hiking backpack ever, but for right now I'll be writing
about it in the context of a family commuter/travel pack.

For background, my wife and I don't really like car travel, so we spend our
transportation budget on backpacks and bikes instead of cars. We're also
efficiency geeks, and we've amassed quite a collection of packs trying to
figure out what gets us out the door fast and lets us get into the flow of
travel - diaper backpacks, duffels, travel backpacks, commuter backpacks,
string bags, and various small and large hiking packs.
