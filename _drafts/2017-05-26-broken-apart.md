As I write this it's been two weeks since I was Morgan's birth partner for
Elliot's birth, and the rawness of what has become my #1 most moving life
experience is starting to wear off.

I'm a fairly analytical, stoic person. In movies like [that movie about everyone seeing things in black and white] I identify with the antagonist - being pulled around by your emotions isn't a core part of what it means to be human, just like the highs and lows of drug use isn't a core part of us either.

Being Morgan's birth partner for Elliot's birth is now my #1 life experience.

As I write this, though, it's been sixteen days since his birth,
and the rawness of the experience is starting to wear off. His moment of birth
is now the most emotional experience I've had; as a fairly stoic person, that
might not be saying much, but still.

At the time, I was floored by how connected
and exposed I felt to the human condition, unlike anything I've experienced.
But not in a "climbed to the top of the mountain" sense, but in a 

### Broken Open

For whatever reason, nature or nurture, I've been a fairly stoic personality for
my adult life. I've been a student of Buddhist and stoic philosophy since my late teens,
and my Myers Briggs type is "The Architect" (INTJ). I find surreal, but detached, joy in
many mundane situations

Normally I live in an emotionally subdued state, and I like it that way. My goal,
even, is to be emotionally stable in order to be open to everyday joys like
rain 

The birth partner experience left me feeling much more emotionally open and
connected than I have ever been.

OK, here's what it was like being Morgan's birth partner for Elliot's birth at
home.

TL;DR, this was my #1 life experience, midwives are badasses, and an obligatory
"I see that look you're giving me - I'm/we're not crazy people, home births are
very safe in the greater Seattle area."

### #1 life experience, and new perspective

This section about being at your child's birth is not homebirth
specific, but it's the most memorable part of my experience, so I have to
include it. Maybe there's some differences at home, but I imagine the birth of
your first child is unreal no matter what environment you're in or how your
story plays out.

For those without kids, I don't mean to create unrealistic emotional
expectations - I certainly had none coming in to it and that's probably for the
better. Everyone told me it was miraculous, but maybe it's because I'm usually
such a robot I didn't really listen, and was particularly blindsided by the feel
train.

Anyways, y'all know my personality, but I'll add that every girl I've dated in
my adult life has called me an emotional robot at some point. Both when Larry
was paralyzed and when he died, I felt it in a very detached way. Larry and I
weren't especially close, but still, I've always wondered if there's something
wrong with me for not feeling his pain and loss more deeply.

In the days directly after Elliot's birth, and still today to a degree, I felt
more connected to humanity than I've ever felt. Not on the spectrum
of sad or happy, but a feeling of rawness like some armor has come off. At
least for a little while.

Relevant to this group, I found my feelings wandering to Larry's family for the
unimaginable loss of their son. Things seemed OK when I visited years ago, but
how could they have been even remotely OK? I think I was just oblivious to
their pain. Also, after Elliot's birth was the first time in ten years I've
taken off my LTB bracelet because it kept getting caught on Elliot's ear with
the football hold, but I also don't feel like I need it as a physical reminder
anymore. I might be OK with it staying in the drawer now.

I also found a bit of regret not feeling more human connection earlier in life.
I mean, thank God I didn't choose the GDI life in college (amirite?), and I'm
not sure exactly what I'm feeling regret for, just a memory of interpersonal
distance that makes me feel like I might have missed something.

Re unmedicated births - even after doing research and asking around, I'm not
really sure how effective epidurals are. I've heard everything from "I felt
nothing from the waist down," to "some things were numb but not everything," to
"I felt all the pain but lacked sensation."

What I can say about Morgan's experience without medication is that, first of all,
"unmedicated" is slightly misleading. She got to a point where she was acting
like those kids in youtube videos of them coming back from the dentist still feeling
the laughing gas. She was hilariously out of it, and having "fun"
(between contractions) until the final few hours when she was on another planet.

Relevant to answering how the unmedicated experience was - the noises Morgan
made were from another realm. FYI, "good" sounds are from the gut and
primal-sounding, "bad" sounds are in the throat like the Wilhelm Scream. Morgan
made all good sounds, but it was still as if she was summoning a child from
another dimension. 
Anyways, evidence of some pretty interesting brain drugs during the birth
experience, and I wasn't even the one laboring!

Qualifiers: I'm not saying this was because of the home birth, nor that it's
universal. 

In order to talk about out-of-hospital / home births, I need to contrast it
with hospital births, but I don't mean to hate on hospital births. When we said
we were having a planned home birth, enough people gave us a look like I just
told them instead of vaccinations we want to send our kids skydiving to scare
the viruses out, so I'm a bit defensive. I have a couple good friends with
traditional OBGYN/pediatrician occupations, and totally respect what they do -
those guys/gals are rock stars. But midwives are too, and bring a different and
needed set of skills everyone should know about.

When you walk into a hospital to deliver, the standard of care at most hospitals
is to have you undress & put on a robe, get in a wheelchair, hook up to constant
monitoring, and hand over your care to the doctors.

In broad strokes, I now see OBGYNs as technicians that know birthing tech and are
especially good at edge cases, but not knowing much about technology-free birth
and far too eager to deploy technology just for the sake of it. Midwives know
women and how to empower them to birth without the need for technology, which
actually improves maternal outcomes a lot.

For example

There is no such thing as a safe and comfortable birth, so 

### Midwives are badasses

I now see OBGYNs as experts at birth tech, and midwives as experts at women in labor.

All midwives, but our midwife in particular, who Morgan and I are both in love
with now. We met a handful of midwives while we were shopping, and they're
all great. I figured they'd just be OBGYNs without the ability to give drugs,
but it turns out they have a whole different birth philosophy that makes so much
sense I had to get my tinfoil hat out of the closet.

I can't say whether there was more or less feels because we were at home,
but I can say that our midwife can relate deeply with a woman in labor and
worked really well with Morgan to create some
very powerful, primal energy. I imagine the bright industrial vibe of a
hospital would harsh the mood a lot, but maybe I was just feeling standard new
dad hormones. I'd be really interested to hear about similar experiences in
other settings.

Anyways, I'd like to write about what exactly I mean by "feels," even though
I've already said how the home birth part went.

me an emotional robot at some point. An example relevant to this group: both

### Midwives are badasses

There is no such thing as a safe and comfortable birth, so we made our decision
to birth at home based on two things.

One, if you want to be in charge of your birth and have a reasonable
chance at an unmedicated birth in America, unfortunately it seems like you have
to start birthing outside of the hospital, statistically speaking.

Two, evidence shows that planned out-of-hospital birth outcomes for low-risk
mothers in areas with a vibrant out-of-hospital scene are as safe as the
hospital for baby, and safer than the hospital for mom. Seattle is a natural
birth hot-spot; we were even able to take a birth class from the person who
wrote one of "the" books on natural birth (and who also happened to be
Maclemore's dula!).

The fact that we could get these outcomes without leaving home was a silver
lining, and we knew nothing about the specifics of midwife care. Looking
back, I can't imagine having the same experience without our midwife, so she
gets a whole section!

Lots of people, especially friends in the medical "establishment" but also
parents and grandparents, clearly saw midwifes as hacks. Two friends in
particular, one OBGYN and one pediatrician, were pleasantly surprised to learn
(after our birth) that they had things like recussitation gear on standby, used
drugs like pitocin after labor for improved maternal outcomes (something both
models of care do), and were trained in minor surgery.

More than knowing medical technology, though, she knows women and how to run an
evidence-based practice (in fact, "evidence based birth" is the midwife mantra).

Here's a representative example:

The fact that mom's dilating has no correlation to any outcome prior to active
labor. She could be 3cm dilated for two weeks before going into labor, or 0cm
dilated the day before. Even if "false labor" starts, there's no point in measuring
dilation until the timing and nature of contractions indicate active labor. Not
only does it not predict labor, I'll repeat, no other outcome is predicted
by the number of cm dilated until labor has actually started.

It's quite common, though, for your OBGYN to start checking cervical dilation
several weeks before mom's due date, and many women find cervical checks to be
a large source of stress. There are many women in one of Morgan's online
support groups who employ a slew of mental preparation and tactics for cold and
painful dilation checks, and their OBGYN is either not aware or does not inform
them that there is no evidence of checking dilation leading to any particular
intervention or outcome.

Our midwives offered dilation checks, but informed us that no medical purpose
exists for measuring dilation other than curiosity. If we were curious, they
would check, but it would not change our care and no evidence shows better
outcomes.

OK, so why the hell does your OBGYN insist on invading your wife's vagina for
no reason?

#####

OK, back to the home birth.

We just now got back from our first PEPS group meeting and I'm a bit shocked, in a "survivor syndrome" sort of way. Out of a dozen couples, almost everyone had a pretty bad C-section story, and the one other couple that delivered vaginally was induced at 41 weeks. One guy in a C-section couple said it was the most amazing moment of his life, which I was glad to hear someone besides us say, but everyone else was not enthusiastic about their experience. It was one tough story after another, then it got to us and we're feeling a combination of surprise and guilt for having a mostly complication free and *relatively* easy experience. I mean, once you have your kiddos and everyone's healthy after a few weeks, I suppose it's all water under the bridge, but for a lot of the people there it still felt like a sore spot.

So, my deepest condolences if you had a rough experience. I still can't imagine going through some of the things I've heard, but at least I know what it feels like to have the stakes be so high. I feel very fortunate for our outcome. 

### Play by play

Elliot's birth is my new #1 life experience.

The gist of it is Morgan went to bed one night feeling crampy, woke up in the morning with real contractions, and delivered our son on the sofa by the evening.

In the morning, once contractions were at a certain pace, intensity, and duration, we called the midwives and our doula so they could ferry over. FYI, the difference between the two is that midwives are like an obstetrician, medically trained and in charge of positive medical outcomes for mom and baby. A doula is there to support the mother physically and psychologically, and evidence shows that doulas measurably improve outcomes, so we hired a professional doula. Money well spent IMO.

While the crew was assembling, Morgan was coping mostly by leaning on stuff/me and a bit of breathing. She could still talk and joke between the contractions for a while, but once the midwives arrived at around noon shit was starting to get more real. Our lead midwife checked cervical dilation (the first time during pregnancy this was checked because evidence shows at any point before this it is contraindicated). Turns out she was 7cm dilated!

This meant it was time for the tub, or the "midwife's epidural." The doula filled the tub with hot water, and when Morgan got in she pretty much took a nap for an hour in the tub. This is why you're supposed to wait until >6cm dilated, because if you get in the tub too early it can stall labor.

At this point she was obviously on some natural drug cocktail. Like someone that had one too many pot brownies, she was eating Phish Food ice cream on the toilet during a few contractions, asking for [stoner voice/smile] "beef" when someone asked her if there's any other food she wanted, dreamily noted that we should keep the birth tub so our side room could always be a pool room (I mean, she wasn't wrong), and was generally hilarious. The midwife gave her the "most fun laboring woman" award.

Up until this point things were easier than we expected. It was early afternoon and she was almost fully dilated, which seemed too easy. I had these little vibrating back massager things I'd use for counter pressure during contractions, the doula kept her hydrated and full of positive mojo, and it was hard, but she was still on this planet.

At some point in the afternoon things started to get harder, and the midwives determined he had his hands by his face, making progression difficult. They didn't tell us this at the time because Morgan had requested to only be informed of medically necessary complications so she wouldn't get discouraged. They have since told us many women would have transfered with a "nuchal hands" presentation. Morgan did a bunch of contractions doing lunges on our stairs, the toilet, and another round in the birth tub until there was a bigger turning point. Not sure whether it was related to his hands coming down or not, 

#####

Wow, newborns are hard. Took 5 weeks to write this down!

TL;DR Elliot's birth is my new #1 life experience (which I was not expecting).

### Play by play

We'd both taken off work starting on Morgan's due date. Since Elliot turned out to be a week late, we had a full additional week to "nest." We were pretty cozy and ready. Here's our 2nd bedroom converted to a birth room:

[pic]

The gist of it is 6 days past due Morgan went to bed feeling crampy, woke up in the morning with real contractions starting, and delivered our son on the sofa by the evening. Pretty friggin rad.

The overall labor was 13 hours, but a bit non standard. She dilated super fast, over 6cm by the time the first midwife made it across the ferry. Unfortunately he was presenting "nuchal hands" (hands by his face), and Morgan spent most the day in pre-pushing labor trying to progress that last bit. At 5:30pm she was fully dilated but he pooped in his waters, so our midwives said we needed to move things along or start to transfer because he can't sit in merconium for too long. "OK, I'M GONNA PUSH HIM OUT!" and one and a half hours of hard pushing later he was born 💪

Highlights:

* First and foremost, birth is unlike anything I could have imagined. Like what I imagine the pain and rawness of war to be like, except creating life. It's also humbling to watch Morgan go through this 9+ month metamorphosis into a human life ship while I pretty much just worked, cooked, and made sperm as always, but it was a joy to be shotgun.
* Midwives are badasses, I had no idea. Our lead midwife in particular has an oxytocin molecule tattoo across her breast, and projected an aura of midwife plus rock star. I felt like she could have delivered our baby on a turbulent airplane full of snakes, no problem (I'm half joking, but only half). Morgan & I both have a heart boner for her now. And until they were needed, they were intentionally hands off so as not to unnecessarily disrupt the process. I'd say they were actively engaged roughly 2-3 hours of a 13 hour labor, the rest of the time they were observing from another room and it was just Morgan, our doula, and me.
* It's impossible to say for sure, but subjectively it seems like the hippie mojo worked. Our bet was that being comfortable in our own den was likely to be more helpful than the harsh setting of the hospital plus drugs, and until she had to push hard at the end she was pretty drugged up on her own brain chemistry anyways. Even epidurals aren't guaranteed to help at the end, so fuck it, and if she paid anything more in pain during labor she's made it up in recovery. More on that in the rant section following.

As a negative, one thing I didn't plan for was how much time preparing for a home birth would take. The midwives are pretty hands-on throughout pregnancy, so we had hour long appointments in West Seattle every month at first, then every other week, then every week. We also had birth classes every week for about 8 weeks plus homework, and we had to turn one of our rooms into a tiny birth/receiving room (stocked with towels, receiving blankets, etc, the midwives brought the emergency medical equipment of course). Nothing huge, just death by a thousand little to-do's that sneak attacked my productivity for the weeks leading up to the birth.

### Hit by the feels train

I don't think this is specific to home birth, but I can't write about it without including how birth was a really emotional experience for me. Everyone told me birth was miraculous; maybe it's because I'm usually such a robot I didn't really listen, and was particularly blindsided by a really strong feeling of connection. Not just happiness about being a dad (that too), but like some emotional armor was thinner. I don't feel that way now, but it's probably a healthy thing for me to try to keep some of that sensitivity.

An example relevant to this group: both when Larry was paralyzed and when he died, I felt it in a fairly detached way. Larry and I weren't especially close, but still, I've always wondered if there's something wrong with me for not feeling his pain and loss more deeply.

Right after the birth, I was surprised to find my feelings wandering to Larry's family for the unimaginable loss of their son. I understand that people inevitably die, "death and taxes" and all, but losing a child... that doesn't have to happen, and I just can't image.

### In defence of home birth

We didn't start out wanting a home birth, but as we did more research that's where we fell. After that decision we drew concern from some friends and family - at best they would call her/us "brave," at worst they would (tactfully) grill us on our transfer plan and wonder out loud "but what if something happens?"

This is both totally understandable, and also frustrating. Modern medicine saves lives in edge cases for sure, but for low-risk pregnancies there's more to the story - a juicy almost-conspiracy even.

The short version is that for low-risk pregnancies in homebirth-friendly areas (access to quality midwives, home birth education classes, good midwife-hospital relationships for smooth transfers, etc) a planned home birth is safer than a hospital birth, even on an island. It doesn't have to be this way, but until some things change in hospitals that's how it is.

For the long version, here's my favorite article in defence of home birth, from a midwife turned "Yale-trained physician and a family doctor with a specialty in obstetrics". A surprising and slightly antagonistic quote to whet your whisle: "a report by The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists itself acknowledged that only about 30% of the obstetrics practices in the US are based on reliable medical evidence."
