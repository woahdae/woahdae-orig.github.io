Or, a review of "Growing Rails Applications in Practice"

What is "better" code, and can I write better code faster?

* Best code is code you don't have to write
  - Avoid going "against the grain" of your framework
* Intention revealing
  - Prioritize why/what, not how
  - Intuitive directory structures & filenames [Robert Martin, others]

Misc alternatives
* http://dry-rb.org/ - A framework bringing in more FP concepts to Ruby
* http://trailblazer.to/ - 

### Yo Dawg, I heard you like frameworks

Rails already has:

* A featurefull, declarative procedure framework (ActiveRecord::Callbacks)
* A data validation framework
* Good namespacing support (especially v5)

Ruby already has:

* Specifying relationships between modules (inheritance)
* Polymorphism
