      <p>
        In a car you're always in a compartment, and because you're used to it you
        don't realize that through that car window everything you see is just more
        TV. You're a passive observer and it is all moving by you boringly in a
        frame.
      </p>

      <p>
        On a cycle the frame is gone. You're completely in contact with it all.
        You're in the scene, not just watching it anymore, and the sense of presence
        is overwhelming.
